gutterballet
============

This plugin uses Matias Bordese's excellent diff parsing library: [python-unidiff](https://github.com/matiasb/python-unidiff)

A minimal Vim git gutter plugin, and perhaps the only Vim plugin named after a Savatage album.

*The code in this repo is under development, and as such should not be expected to work well, or even work at all*

This README will be updated once the plugin is ready for general use.


Usage
-----
Install with your favorite plugin manager, and:

    $ pip install unidiff

TODO
----
* Testing
* Make diff command configurable
* Flesh out README
