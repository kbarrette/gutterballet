gutterballet
============
***
NOTE: The code in this repo mostly works, but is no longer under development - [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) now supports async diffing and is much more actively maintained.
***

This plugin uses Matias Bordese's excellent diff parsing library: [python-unidiff](https://github.com/matiasb/python-unidiff)

A minimal Vim diff gutter plugin, and perhaps the only Vim plugin named after a Savatage album.

*The code in this repo is under development, and as such should not be expected to work well, or even work at all*

This README will be updated once the plugin is ready for general use.


Usage
-----
Install with your favorite plugin manager, and:

    $ pip install unidiff
