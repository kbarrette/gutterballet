gutterballet
============

A minimal Vim git gutter plugin, and perhaps the only Vim plugin named after a Savatage album.

*The code in this repo is under development, and as such should not be expected to work well, or even work at all*

This README will be updated with usage instructions once the plugin is ready for general use.
